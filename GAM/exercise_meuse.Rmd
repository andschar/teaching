This exercise is taken from Noam Ross' [GAM course](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/)

# Setup
```{r setup}
require(mgcv)
```

# Data
```{r data}
data(meuse, package = 'sp')
head(meuse)
```

# Task

## Model Spatial interaction
  
- Model cadmium in response to the coordinates
- Try Gaussian and Gamma family distributions
- Include the coordinates in an interaction term
  - Which smooth term to use?

## Model spatial interaction and additional covariates

- Add dist and elev to model
- Does it improve the quality of the model?

## Visualize the better fit model

# Variables

x,y --> coordinates<br>
cadmium, copper, lead, zinc --> responses<br>
elev --> elevation<br>
dist --> distance from meuse river<br>
dist.m --> distance in meter<br>
om --> organic matter<br>
soil --> soil type<br>
lime --> lime factor<br>
