## Task

CO2 uptake in grasses under varying concentrations of CO2.
Two Locations: Mississippi, Quebec (Variable: Type).

## Task

Model the CO2 `uptake` of plants between different locations. Use the covariates
`conc`, the CO2 concentration and `Plant_uo` in the model.

Create a GS, GI, S, and I model as described in the lecture (resp. Pedersen et al. 2019).

## Data

```{r}
CO2$Plant_uo = factor(CO2$Plant, ordered = FALSE) # remove ordering factor

head(CO2)
```

## Models

### Model G

```{r}
modG = gam(uptake ~ s(conc, k = 5, bs = "tp") +
             s(Plant_uo, k = 12, bs = "re"),
           data = CO2,
           method = "REML",
           family = "gaussian")
summary(modG)
plot(modG, pages = 1)
AIC(modG)
```
